<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>What distinguishes chicken karahi from other curries from the region is that traditionally, it is cooked without
    onions in the base, and instead uses just tomatoes, ginger and garlic. It is usually served with naan, roti or rice.
    This dish is one of the hallmarks of North Indian, Afghan and Pakistani cuisine.</P>
