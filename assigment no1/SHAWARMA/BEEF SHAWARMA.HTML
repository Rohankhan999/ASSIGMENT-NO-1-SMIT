    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <P>Beef Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish enjoyed around the world, including in Pakistan. It consists of thinly
        sliced marinated beef, which is stacked on a vertical rotisserie and slowly roasted to perfection. The marination
        typically includes a blend of spices, yogurt, garlic, and lemon juice, imparting a rich, tangy flavor to the meat.
        Once cooked, the beef is shaved off the rotisserie and wrapped in warm pita bread or flatbread, often accompanied by
        fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions, and topped with tahini, garlic sauce, or hummus. The
        combination of the juicy, flavorful beef with the fresh, crunchy vegetables and creamy sauces makes Beef Shawarma a
        delicious and satisfying meal.</P>
