<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>Lamb shawarma is a savory and aromatic Middle Eastern dish made from thinly sliced cuts of marinated lamb, typically
    cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The lamb is seasoned with a flavorful blend of spices such as cumin, paprika,
    garlic, and coriander before being slow-cooked to tender perfection. Once cooked, the juicy lamb slices are usually
    wrapped in a warm pita bread or served in a plate with fresh vegetables like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and
    cucumber. It's often accompanied by a tangy tahini or garlic sauce, adding a creamy contrast to the robust flavors
    of the lamb. Lamb shawarma is beloved for its rich taste and satisfying texture, making it a popular street food and
    restaurant staple enjoyed worldwide.</P>
