    <H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>A Chicken Burger is a popular alternative to the classic beef burger, featuring a juicy chicken patty made from
    either grilled, fried, or breaded chicken breast. It's typically served in a bun and topped with fresh ingredients
    like lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise, although variations might include cheese, pickles, onions, and various sauces.
    The chicken burger is known for its lighter, leaner profile compared to beef, making it a versatile option for those
    seeking a different flavor or a slightly healthier choice without sacrificing taste.</P>
