    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>A cheeseburger is a classic variation of the traditional hamburger, distinguished by the addition of melted cheese on
    top of the beef patty. The cheese, commonly cheddar, Swiss, or American, adds a creamy texture and rich flavor that
    complements the savory beef. Typically, a cheeseburger is served with standard toppings like lettuce, tomato, onion,
    and pickles, along with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. The combination of juicy beef, melted
    cheese, and fresh toppings makes the cheeseburger a beloved and iconic dish in American cuisine, enjoyed at diners,
    fast-food restaurants, and backyard barbecues alike.</P>
