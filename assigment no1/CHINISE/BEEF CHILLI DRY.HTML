    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <P>Beef Chilli Dry is a popular Indo-Chinese dish widely enjoyed in Pakistan. This flavorful dish features thin
        strips of beef stir-fried with green chilies, bell peppers, onions, and garlic. The beef is typically marinated
        in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar, and spices before being cooked at high heat to achieve a slightly crispy
        texture. The dish is known for its spicy and savory taste, with a perfect balance of heat from the chilies and
        umami from the soy sauce. Beef Chilli Dry is often served as a starter or main course, accompanied by fried rice
        or noodles, making it a favorite in many Pakistani households and restaurants.</P>
