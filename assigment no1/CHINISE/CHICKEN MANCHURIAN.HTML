    <P>Chicken Manchurian is a popular Indo-Chinese dish widely enjoyed in Pakistan. It features succulent pieces of
        fried chicken tossed in a tangy and slightly spicy sauce made from a blend of soy sauce, ketchup, and chili
        sauce. The dish often includes vegetables like bell peppers, onions, and spring onions, adding color and crunch.
        Chicken Manchurian is typically served with fried rice or noodles, making it a flavorful and satisfying meal.
