<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>Lobster is a luxurious and highly prized shellfish known for its sweet, tender meat and distinctive flavor. Found in
    cold waters around the world, lobsters are characterized by their hard exoskeletons, large claws, and long antennae.
    They are typically cooked by boiling or steaming, which brings out the lobster's succulent texture and delicate
    taste. Often served with melted butter or in dishes like lobster rolls and lobster thermidor, lobster is celebrated
    as a gourmet delicacy in many cuisines, symbolizing indulgence and culinary excellence.</P>
