<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>Crabs are crustaceans found in oceans, seas, and freshwater habitats worldwide. They are known for their hard
    exoskeletons, which they periodically shed as they grow. Crabs have ten legs, with the front pair often modified
    into claws, or "chelae," which they use for defense, feeding, and communication. These decapod crustaceans are
    omnivorous, feeding on a variety of foods such as algae, mollusks, small fish, and even detritus. They are prized in
    many cuisines for their sweet and succulent meat, enjoyed in dishes like crab cakes, crab bisque, and crab legs with
    butter. Crabs play a crucial role in marine ecosystems as both predators and prey, contributing to the balance of
    coastal and aquatic food webs.</P>
