    <H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
    <P>A berry milkshake is a refreshing and delicious drink made by blending fresh or frozen berries with milk, ice
        cream, and sometimes a sweetener like sugar or honey. Common berries used include strawberries, blueberries,
        raspberries, and blackberries, offering a vibrant mix of flavors and a beautiful, natural color. The result is a
        creamy, fruity shake that is both satisfying and nutritious, packed with vitamins, antioxidants, and the
        goodness of dairy. Berry milkshakes are perfect for a hot day, as a dessert, or a sweet treat any time of the
        year.</P>
