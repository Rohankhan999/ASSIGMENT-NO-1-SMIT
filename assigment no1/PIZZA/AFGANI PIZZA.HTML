<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>Afghani Pizza is a unique and flavorful fusion dish popular in Pakistan, blending traditional Afghan flavors with the
    classic Italian pizza. This pizza is typically topped with succulent pieces of Afghani-style chicken tikka, which is
    marinated in a mixture of yogurt, cream, and a blend of spices. The pizza often includes additional toppings such as
    onions, bell peppers, and green chilies, which add a fresh and spicy kick. The creamy, mildly spiced chicken pairs
    beautifully with the cheese and crisp crust, creating a delicious and satisfying meal that reflects a delightful mix
    of culinary traditions.</P>
