    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
    <P>Vegetarian pizza is a delightful and popular choice for those who prefer a meatless option. It typically features a
        vibrant array of fresh vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, olives, and spinach, all
        layered atop a crisp, golden crust. The pizza is generously topped with mozzarella cheese and often enhanced with
        flavorful herbs like basil and oregano. Some variations might include unique toppings like artichokes, zucchini, or
        even corn. The combination of the rich tomato sauce, melted cheese, and diverse vegetables creates a delicious,
        satisfying, and colorful meal that appeals to vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.</P>
