<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>Fajita Pizza is a delicious fusion dish that combines the flavors of Mexican fajitas with the classic appeal of
    pizza. This pizza is typically topped with marinated chicken or beef strips, bell peppers, onions, and a blend of
    spices, capturing the essence of fajitas. The toppings are spread over a crispy pizza crust and covered with melted
    cheese, creating a savory and tangy flavor profile. Often garnished with cilantro and sometimes served with a side
    of salsa or sour cream, Fajita Pizza offers a unique and flavorful twist, appealing to those who enjoy a blend of
    international cuisines.</P>
