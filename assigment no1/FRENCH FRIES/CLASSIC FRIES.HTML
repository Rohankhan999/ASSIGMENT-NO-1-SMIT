    <H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>Classic fries, also known as straight-cut fries, are a timeless favorite in the world of snacks and side dishes.
    These medium-width strips of potato are deep-fried to perfection, resulting in a golden-brown exterior that is
    crispy, with a fluffy, tender interior. Their straightforward preparation and neutral flavor make them a versatile
    accompaniment to a wide range of dishes, from burgers and sandwiches to grilled meats and salads. Served hot and
    often seasoned lightly with salt, classic fries can be enjoyed on their own or dipped in sauces like ketchup,
    mayonnaise, or aioli, making them a universally loved comfort food.</P>
