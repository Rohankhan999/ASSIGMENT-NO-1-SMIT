    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>Pizza fries are a delightful fusion of two beloved comfort foods: pizza and French fries. They typically feature
    crispy French fries as a base, topped with pizza-inspired ingredients such as melted mozzarella cheese, marinara
    sauce, pepperoni slices, and sometimes additional toppings like bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms. The combination
    creates a savory and indulgent dish that blends the flavors of pizza with the satisfying crunch of fries. Pizza
    fries are often served as a shareable appetizer or as a unique twist on traditional pizza, appealing to those who
    enjoy both classic dishes.</P>
