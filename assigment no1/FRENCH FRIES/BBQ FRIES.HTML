<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<P>BBQ fries are a delightful twist on traditional French fries, popular for their smoky and savory flavor profile.
    These fries are typically seasoned with a barbecue spice blend or sauce, which can include elements like paprika,
    garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and brown sugar, lending them a sweet and tangy taste. The fries are often served
    crispy and hot, with the barbecue seasoning adding a rich depth of flavor that pairs well with various dipping
    sauces like ranch or BBQ sauce. BBQ fries are a favorite at casual dining spots, barbecues, and food trucks,
    offering a satisfying and indulgent snack or side dish option..</P>
