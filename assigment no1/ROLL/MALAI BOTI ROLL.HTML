<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>Malai Boti Roll is a popular and delicious street food from Pakistan. This dish consists of tender, marinated pieces
    of chicken, known as "boti," which are grilled to perfection. The chicken is marinated in a creamy mixture of
    yogurt, cream, and a blend of spices, giving it a rich and flavorful taste. Once cooked, the succulent chicken is
    wrapped in a warm, soft paratha or naan, along with fresh vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and often
    topped with a tangy chutney or raita. The combination of the juicy, flavorful chicken with the fresh, crunchy
    vegetables and soft bread makes Malai Boti Roll a delightful and satisfying meal.</P>
