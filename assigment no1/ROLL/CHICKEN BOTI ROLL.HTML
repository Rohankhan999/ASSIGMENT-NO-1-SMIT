    <H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>The Chicken Boti Roll is a popular street food in South Asia, particularly in Pakistan and India. It consists of
    succulent, marinated chicken chunks, known as "boti," which are grilled or cooked on skewers. These flavorful pieces
    of chicken are then wrapped in a soft, freshly made flatbread, often a paratha or naan. The roll is typically
    garnished with fresh vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and accompanied by a variety of sauces and
    chutneys, adding a tangy and spicy kick. The Chicken Boti Roll is beloved for its combination of smoky, spicy, and
    savory flavors, making it a delicious and convenient meal option.</P>
