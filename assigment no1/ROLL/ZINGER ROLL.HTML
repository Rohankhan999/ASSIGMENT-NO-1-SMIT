    <H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
    <P>The Zinger Roll is a popular fast-food item, known for its crispy and spicy chicken filling. Originating from KFC,
        the roll features a piece of fried chicken, often marinated with a blend of spices to give it a signature zesty
        flavor. It is typically wrapped in a soft, fresh tortilla or flatbread and accompanied by fresh lettuce, mayonnaise,
        and sometimes additional vegetables or cheese. The combination of the crunchy chicken, cool lettuce, and creamy mayo
        creates a delicious contrast in textures and flavors, making the Zinger Roll a favorite choice for a quick and
        satisfying meal.</P>
